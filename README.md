# Mentoring at Hackathon RIIAA 2021 “JusticIA para los desaparecidos”
I am creating this repository to put together few references that might be helpful for the participants of the [Hackathon RIIAA 2021 “JusticIA para los desaparecidos”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4cKb-VQ6WOTmxnj1yc_pmQwYRFwmTxmf6xndlFYKmg/edit). 
References are related to the topics of image processing and recognition and text extraction.
